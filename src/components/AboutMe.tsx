            I&apos;m {getAge()} years old and currently work as a data analyst
            focused on finance. I use Power BI, Python, and SQL to analyze
            financial data, create dashboards, and optimize business processes.
            <br />
            Previously, I worked as a full-stack developer at a digital bank,
            contributing to systems using NestJS, TypeScript, and React. That
            experience sharpened my technical and analytical skills, which I now
            apply to data-driven decision-making.
            <br />
            Iâ€™m based in{" "}
            <strong className="text-green-600 font-medium">Brazil</strong> and
            currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. My passion for
            technology started in childhood, and today, I enjoy turning complex
            data into clear insights that support growth and innovation.
